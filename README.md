This Python code creates a "Secure Password Generator" application using the Tkinter library, providing a graphical user interface (GUI). The application allows users to generate a random password based on customizable options, such as including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Additionally, it includes features like password length adjustment, copying the password to the clipboard, and toggling between light and dark themes.

1. Importing Libraries:
tkinter and ttk: Tkinter is used for creating GUI components, while ttk provides themed widgets such as the slider.
messagebox: Used for displaying warnings and information messages to the user.
random and string: Used for generating the random password.
pyperclip: A library that allows copying text to the clipboard.
2. Password Generation - generate_password():
Retrieves the selected password length from the slider (length_var.get()).
Validates that the password length is at least 6 characters for security purposes.
Constructs a character set based on the selected options (uppercase, lowercase, numeric, symbols).
If no character type is selected, it warns the user to select at least one.
Generates a random password using the selected character set and updates the password_var to display the generated password.
3. Copy to Clipboard - copy_to_clipboard():
Copies the generated password to the clipboard using the pyperclip.copy() function.
Displays an information message to confirm that the password has been copied.
4. Updating Length Display - update_length_display():
Updates the display label to reflect the current password length selected by the user through the slider.
5. Toggling Between Light and Dark Mode - toggle_theme():
Switches the theme of the application between dark mode and light mode.
Adjusts background and foreground colors for various widgets, including the main window, buttons, and entry fields.
Also updates the style of the slider to match the selected theme.
6. GUI Setup:
Main Window (root): The primary window for the application, initialized with a dark background.
Customization Frame (customize_frame): A labeled frame that contains options for customizing the password.
Includes checkboxes for selecting character types (uppercase, lowercase, numeric, symbols).
A slider (length_slider) for adjusting the password length, with a corresponding label (length_display) to show the selected length.
Generate Button: A button to generate the password based on the selected options.
Password Display: An entry widget to display the generated password.
Copy Button: A button to copy the generated password to the clipboard.
Theme Toggle Button: A button to toggle between dark and light modes, represented by a moon/sun emoji (ðŸŒ“).
7. Styling:
The application is styled to match the dark theme initially, with dark backgrounds and light text.
The slider's style is also customized to match the theme.
The toggle button allows users to switch to a light theme with corresponding adjustments to widget colors.
8. User Interaction:
Users can customize the password by selecting character types and adjusting the length.
After generating a password, they can copy it to the clipboard for use.
Users can switch between dark and light themes according to their preference.
9. Running the Application:
root.mainloop(): Starts the Tkinter event loop, making the application responsive and interactive.
